Here's a brief explanation about CPF:

CPF is a record maintained by the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service and serves as an identification document for Brazilian citizens. The CPF is a unique and permanent number assigned to each individual and is used in various financial and civil transactions in Brazil, such as opening bank accounts, obtaining credit, purchasing properties, among other activities. It is similar to what other countries refer to as a tax identification number or social security number."
